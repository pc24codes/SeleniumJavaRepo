This is a Selenium testing framework creating with Cucumber and follows the PageObject model. Test data is maintained using JSON files.
Here the application under test is https://www.saucedemo.com/
This framework currently supports Chrome and Edge. Unlike the previous selenium frameworks, this does not use seperate binaries for driver objects.
The code completely relies on locally installed browser & initiates the testing. 
To Change the browser for testing, We can change the browser value from the properties file.
